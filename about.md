Hi, I'm Jack.

I work in software development with things like C# and .NET, building web applications and solutions for businesses. That's why I created this site, so I could share things I've learnt about software development and contribute to the wider community of professionals and amateurs. 

You can find my social app links at the end of the page if you'd like to contact me.
